Many years ago there was a boy named Charles. Charles dreamed of leaving home and finding treasure. 
However, his parents did not want him to leave home, because they only saw him as a child.
Therefore, Charles spent his days helping his mother with chores around the house and hanging 
out with his two best friends, Lucy and Dawson, who both saw something very special in Charles.
Charles' parents did not believe in him, but what they did not know was that he was a very 
smart young boy, who with the help of his friends, was capable of incredible things.
