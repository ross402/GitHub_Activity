Many years ago there was a boy named Charles. Charles dreamed of leaving home and finding treasure. 
However, his parents did not want him to leave home, because they only saw him as a child.
Therefore, Charles spent his days helping his mother with chores around the house and hanging 
out with his two best friends, Lucy and Dawson, who both saw something very special in Charles.
Charles' parents did not believe in him, but what they did not know was that he was a very 
smart young boy, who with the help of his friends, was capable of incredible things. 

Charles started planning to sneak out and adventure from a young age. But Charles did not wish to sneak 
out and be reckless as most children his age would be when directly disobeying their parents. Charles, a 
bookworm, read of stories of great adventurers who would travel the world and hide their valuables, leaving 
behind clues for the curious and brilliant to find at a later time. While most who attempt these grand adventures 
come back empty handed or spend their lives forever chasing the treasures to no avail, Charles was different. Unlike
his predecessors, Charles was an incredible problem solver with a persistent drive, and with the help of his friends, 
he planned to take on one of these treasure hunts once and for all.
